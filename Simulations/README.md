This directory contains the specification of the simulations in AbacusSummit.

Each simulation has a name, which is both the name of the subdirectory and the 
SimName inside the parameter file.  Inside the subdirectory is the abacus.par2
file, which is the user-customized instructions to the code, and some of the 
major outputs.

Outputs: We may want to check in the final parameter file (abacus.par) as
well as the final status.log.
