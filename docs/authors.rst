Acknowledgements & Thanks
-------------------------
Abacus development has been supported by NSF AST-1313285 and more
recently by DOE-SC0013718, as well as by Simons Foundation funds
and Harvard University startup funds.  NM was supported as a NSF
Graduate Research Fellow.  The AbacusCosmos simulations were run
on the El Gato supercomputer at the University of Arizona, supported
by grant 1228509 from the NSF; the AbacusSummit simulations have
been supported by OLCF projects AST135 and AST145, the latter through
the Department of Energy ALCC program.

We would like to thank OLCF and NERSC support for their expert
assistance with the many hurdles that come with executing an HPC
project at this scale.
