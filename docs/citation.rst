Citation
--------
.. TODO: are we asking users to cite all of these papers? Let's be clear.

Use of AbacusSummit should cite `Maksimova et al. (2021) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/508/3/4017/6366248>`_ for the
simulation suite; `Garrison et al. (2021) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/508/1/575/6366254>`_, `Garrison et al. (2019) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/485/3/3370/5371170>`_,
and `Garrison et al. (2018) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/aabfd3>`_ for the Abacus code;
and `Metchnik (2009) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009PhDT.......175M/abstract>`_
for the initial method.  
Applications using the CompaSO halos should cite `Hadzhiyska et al. (2021) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/mnras/stab2980/6402914>`_ for that method, and those using the AbacusSummit halo light cone catalogues should cite `Hadzhiyska et al. (2021) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/mnras/stab3066/6408495>`_. The AbacusSummit merger trees are described in `Bose et al.<https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11409>`_, and the AbacusHOD model is described in `Yuan  et al.<https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11412>`_. 
Other citations may be requested as we publish more of the numerical methods.

Abacus is described in `Garrison et al. (2019, MNRAS, 485, 3370) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/485/3/3370/5371170>`_,
where we detail its performance on the `Schneider et al. (2016) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2016/04/047>`_ code
comparison simulation, and in `Garrison et al. (2018, ApJS, 236,
43) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/aabfd3>`_,
which released an early suite of 125 simulations from 40
cosmologies (https://lgarrison.github.io/AbacusCosmos/).

`Garrison et al. (2016) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/461/4/4125/2608725>`_ describes
our initial condition methods. Hadzhiyska et al. (in prep) will
describe the CompaSO group finding method.  Pinto et al. (in prep) will
describe the Abacus far-field method.  Using scale-free simulations, `Joyce et al. (2021) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.5051J/abstract>`_
describes accuracy tests, and `Garrison et al. (2021) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.tmp.1117G/abstract>`_
validates the force softening scheme.
