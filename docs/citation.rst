Citation
--------
.. TODO: are we asking users to cite all of these papers? Let's be clear.

Use of AbacusSummit should cite Maksimova et al. (in prep) for the
simulation suite and `Garrison et al. (2019) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/485/3/3370/5371170>`_
and `Garrison et al. (2018) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/aabfd3>`_ for the Abacus code,
and `Metchnik (2009) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009PhDT.......175M/abstract>`_
for the initial method.  
Applications using the CompaSO halos should cite Hadzhiyska et al. (in prep) for that method.
Other citations may be requested as we publish more of the numerical methods.

.. note:: We provide a BibTeX file with these references `here <https://github.com/abacusorg/AbacusSummit/blob/master/papers.bib>`_.

Papers
-------
Abacus is described in `Garrison et al. (2019, MNRAS, 485, 3370) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/485/3/3370/5371170>`_,
where we detail its performance on the `Schneider et al. (2016) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2016/04/047>`_ code
comparison simulation, and in `Garrison et al. (2018, ApJS, 236,
43) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/aabfd3>`_,
which released an early suite of 125 simulations from 40
cosmologies (https://lgarrison.github.io/AbacusCosmos/).

`Garrison et al. (2016) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/461/4/4125/2608725>`_ describes
our initial condition methods.  Hadzhiyska et al. (in prep) will
describe the CompaSO group finding method.  Pinto et al. (in prep) will
describe the Abacus far-field method.  Joyce et al. (submitted)
describes accuracy tests using scale-free simulations.
