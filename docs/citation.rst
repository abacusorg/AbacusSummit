Citation
--------
.. TODO: are we asking users to cite all of these papers? Let's be clear.

Use of AbacusSummit should cite Maksimova et al. (in prep) for the
simulation suite and `Garrison et al. (2019) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/485/3/3370/5371170>`_
and `Garrison et al. (2018) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/aabfd3>`_ for the Abacus code,
and `Metchnik (2009) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009PhDT.......175M/abstract>`_
for the initial method.  Other citations may be requested as we publish more of the
numerical methods.

.. note:: We provide a BibTeX file with these references `here <https://github.com/abacusorg/AbacusSummit/blob/master/papers.bib>`_.

Papers
-------
Abacus is described in `Garrison et al. (2019, MNRAS, 485, 3370) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/485/3/3370/5371170>`_,
where we detail its performance on the `Schneider et al. (2016) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2016/04/047>`_ code
comparison simulation, and in `Garrison et al. (2018, ApJS, 236,
43) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/aabfd3>`_,
which released an early suite of 125 simulations from 40
cosmologies (https://lgarrison.github.io/AbacusCosmos/).

`Garrison et al. (2016) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/461/4/4125/2608725>`_ describes
our initial condition methods.  Hadzhiyska et al. (in prep) will
describe our SO group finding method.  Pinto et al. (in prep) will
describe the Abacus far-field method.  Joyce et al. (submitted)
describes accuracy tests using scale-free simulations.

--------------------------
Abacus is currently actively developed by `Lehman Garrison <https://lgarrison.github.io>`_, Nina
Maksimova, and Daniel Eisenstein, with contributions from Boryana
Hadzhiyska and Sownak Bose and consulting from Philip Pinto.  Abacus
was initially developed by Marc Metchnik and Philip Pinto, with
contributions from Daniel Eisenstein and later development led by
Douglas Ferrer.

Abacus development has been supported by NSF AST-1313285 and more
recently by DOE-SC0013718, as well as by Simons Foundation funds
and Harvard University startup funds.  NM was supported as a NSF
Graduate Research Fellow.  The AbacusCosmos simulations were run
on the El Gato supercomputer at the University of Arizona, supported
by grant 1228509 from the NSF; the AbacusSummit simulations have
been supported by OLCF projects AST135 and AST145, the latter through
the Department of Energy ALCC program.
