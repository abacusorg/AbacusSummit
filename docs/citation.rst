    .. tip::
        We provide a BibTeX file with the references on this page `here <https://github.com/abacusorg/AbacusSummit/blob/master/papers.bib>`__.

Use of AbacusSummit should cite at least the following two papers:

* *AbacusSummit: a massive set of high-accuracy, high-resolution N-body simulations*, `Maksimova et al. (2021) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/508/3/4017/6366248>`__ (describes the simulation suite), and
* *The abacus cosmological N-body code*, `Garrison et al. (2021) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/508/1/575/6366254>`__ (describes the code).

Users of the AbacusSummit CompaSO halo catalogs (which will be most AbacusSummit users) should additionally cite:

* *CompaSO: A new halo finder for competitive assignment to spherical overdensities*, `Hadzhiyska et al. (2021) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/mnras/stab2980/6402914>`__ (the CompaSO group finding method)

Users of the AbacusSummit halo light cone catalogs should cite:

* *The halo light cone catalogues of AbacusSummit*, `Hadzhiyska et al. (2021) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/mnras/stab3066/6408495>`__ (the generation of halo catalogs on the light cone)

Users of the AbacusSummit merger trees should cite:

* *Constructing high-fidelity halo merger trees in abacussummit*, `Bose et al. (2022) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/512/1/837/6541858>`__ (the merger tree method)

Users of the AbacusHOD module (:doc:`abacusutils:hod`) should cite:

* *AbacusHOD: a highly efficient extended multitracer HOD framework and its application to BOSS and eBOSS data*, `Yuan  et al. (2021) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/510/3/3301/6446006>`__


Additional citations of Abacus (which might be used when a work goes beyond just using AbacusSummit data products and is discussing the Abacus code itself) are:

* *A high-fidelity realization of the Euclid code comparison N-body simulation with ABACUS*, `Garrison et al. (2019) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/485/3/3370/5371170>`__ (performance and accuracy of Abacus on the Euclid code comparison simulation, `Schneider et al. (2016) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2016/04/047>`__)
* *The Abacus Cosmos: A suite of cosmological N-body simulations*, `Garrison et al. (2018) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/aabfd3>`__ (an early suite of 125 simulations from 40 cosmologies, https://lgarrison.github.io/AbacusCosmos/),
* *Improving initial conditions for cosmological N-body simulations*, `Garrison et al. (2016) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/461/4/4125/2608725>`__ (detailing the initial conditions method)
* *A fast N-body scheme for computational cosmology*, `Metchnik (2009) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009PhDT.......175M/abstract>`__ (the inception of the mathematical method for the force solver).

Other Abacus citations may be requested as we publish more of the numerical methods.

A related series of papers investigating the accuracy of Abacus and N-body simulations in general using scale-free simulations may be of interest as well:

* *Accuracy of power spectra in dissipationless cosmological simulations*, `Maleubre et al. (2022) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/512/2/1829/6544652>`__ (likewise assesses the accuracy of power spectra)
* *Self-similarity of k-nearest neighbour distributions in scale-free simulations*, `Garrison, Abel, and Eisenstein (2021) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/509/2/2281/6414535>`__
* *Good and proper: self-similarity of N-body simulations with proper force softening*, `Garrison et al. (2021) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/504/3/3550/6246417>`__ (validates the force softening scheme using scale-free simulations)
* *Quantifying resolution in cosmological N-body simulations using self-similarity*, `Joyce et al. (2021) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/501/4/5051/5979795>`__ (describes accuracy tests using scale-free simulations)
