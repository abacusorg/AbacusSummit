Data Access
===========

DESI Members
------------
DESI collaboration members can access the AbacusSummit data products on NERSC.
The path to the data products can be found on the DESI Wiki: https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/CosmoSimsWG/Abacus#AbacusSummit

Public
-------
The simulation suite is currently in a beta version, available only with agreement.  
We plan to issue a first release into the public domain in summer 2021.

That said, the outputs are sufficiently large that arranging access
to them is challenging and cannot be promised, and we are not able at this time to provide an on-line portal.
Please email deisenstein@cfa.harvard.edu, lgarrison@flatironinstitute.org, and nina.maksimova@cfa.harvard.edu to discuss
how we might be able to transfer some or all of the suite to you.  Transfers to the data centers of other large collaborations 
who can then serve their own members will get priority.  

In the near-term, we hope to provide a sample simulation through an on-line portal, in the hopes that this will
help people assess how AbacusSummit might help them.

What data are available?
------------------------
The :doc:`data-products` page documents the data products.  
In some cases, extra data products may be archived on tape and can be made available upon request.
Please email the authors for details.

Note that you will almost certainly need to use the utilities at
https://abacusutils.readthedocs.io/
to unpack the outputs.
