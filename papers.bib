    abstract = "{We present abacus, a fast and accurate cosmological N-body code based on a new method for calculating the gravitational potential from a static multipole mesh. The method analytically separates the near- and far-field forces, reducing the former to direct 1/r2 summation and the latter to a discrete convolution over multipoles. The method achieves 70 million particle updates per second per node of the Summit supercomputer, while maintaining a median fractional force error of 10−5. We express the simulation time-step as an event-driven ‘pipeline’, incorporating asynchronous events such as completion of co-processor work, input/output, and network communication. abacus has been used to produce the largest suite of N-body simulations to date, the abacussummit suite of 60 trillion particles, incorporating on-the-fly halo finding. abacus enables the production of mock catalogues of the volume and resolution required by the coming generation of cosmological surveys.}",

    journal = {Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society},
    year = {2021},
    month = {10},
    abstract = "{We describe a new method (CompaSO) for identifying groups of particles in cosmological N-body simulations. CompaSO builds upon existing spherical overdensity (SO) algorithms by taking into consideration the tidal radius around a smaller halo before competitively assigning halo membership to the particles. In this way, the CompaSO finder allows for more effective deblending of haloes in close proximity as well as the formation of new haloes on the outskirts of larger ones. This halo-finding algorithm is used in the AbacusSummit suite of N-body simulations, designed to meet the cosmological simulation requirements of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. CompaSO is developed as a highly efficient on-the-fly group finder, which is crucial for enabling good load-balancing between the GPU and CPU and the creation of high-resolution merger trees. In this paper, we describe the halo-finding procedure and its particular implementation in Abacus, accompanying it with a qualitative analysis of the finder. We test the robustness of the CompaSO catalogues before and after applying the cleaning method described in an accompanying paper and demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it with other validation techniques. We then visualise the haloes and their density profiles, finding that they are well fit by the NFW formalism. Finally, we compare other properties such as radius-mass relationships and two-point correlation functions with that of another widely used halo finder, rockstar.}",

    abstract = "{We describe a method for generating halo catalogues on the light cone using the AbacusSummit suite of N-body simulations. The main application of these catalogues is the construction of realistic mock galaxy catalogues and weak lensing maps on the sky. Our algorithm associates the haloes from a set of coarsely-spaced snapshots with their positions at the time of light-cone crossing by matching halo particles to on-the-fly light cone particles. It then records the halo and particle information into an easily accessible product, which we call the AbacusSummit halo light cone catalogues. Our recommended use of this product is in the halo mass regime of Mhalo \\&gt; 2.1 × 1011 M⊙/h for the base resolution simulations, i.e. haloes containing at least 100 particles, where the interpolated halo properties are most reliable. To test the validity of the obtained catalogues, we perform various visual inspections and consistency checks. In particular, we construct galaxy mock catalogues of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) at z ∼ 1 by adopting a modified version of the AbacusHOD script, which builds on the standard halo occupation distribution (HOD) method by including various extensions. We find that the multipoles of the auto-correlation function are consistent with the predictions from the full-box snapshot, implicitly validating our algorithm. In addition, we compute and output CMB convergence maps and find that the auto- and cross-power spectrum agrees with the theoretical prediction at the subpercent level. Halo light cone catalogues for 25 base and 2 huge simulations at the fiducial cosmology is available at DOI:10.13139/OLCF/1825069}",
