    abstract = "{We describe a new method (CompaSO) for identifying groups of particles in cosmological N-body simulations. CompaSO builds upon existing spherical overdensity (SO) algorithms by taking into consideration the tidal radius around a smaller halo before competitively assigning halo membership to the particles. In this way, the CompaSO finder allows for more effective deblending of haloes in close proximity as well as the formation of new haloes on the outskirts of larger ones. This halo-finding algorithm is used in the AbacusSummit suite of N-body simulations, designed to meet the cosmological simulation requirements of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. CompaSO is developed as a highly efficient on-the-fly group finder, which is crucial for enabling good load-balancing between the GPU and CPU and the creation of high-resolution merger trees. In this paper, we describe the halo-finding procedure and its particular implementation in Abacus, accompanying it with a qualitative analysis of the finder. We test the robustness of the CompaSO catalogues before and after applying the cleaning method described in an accompanying paper and demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it with other validation techniques. We then visualise the haloes and their density profiles, finding that they are well fit by the NFW formalism. Finally, we compare other properties such as radius-mass relationships and two-point correlation functions with that of another widely used halo finder, rockstar.}",

    abstract = "{We describe a method for generating halo catalogues on the light cone using the AbacusSummit suite of N-body simulations. The main application of these catalogues is the construction of realistic mock galaxy catalogues and weak lensing maps on the sky. Our algorithm associates the haloes from a set of coarsely-spaced snapshots with their positions at the time of light-cone crossing by matching halo particles to on-the-fly light cone particles. It then records the halo and particle information into an easily accessible product, which we call the AbacusSummit halo light cone catalogues. Our recommended use of this product is in the halo mass regime of Mhalo \\&gt; 2.1 × 1011 M⊙/h for the base resolution simulations, i.e. haloes containing at least 100 particles, where the interpolated halo properties are most reliable. To test the validity of the obtained catalogues, we perform various visual inspections and consistency checks. In particular, we construct galaxy mock catalogues of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) at z ∼ 1 by adopting a modified version of the AbacusHOD script, which builds on the standard halo occupation distribution (HOD) method by including various extensions. We find that the multipoles of the auto-correlation function are consistent with the predictions from the full-box snapshot, implicitly validating our algorithm. In addition, we compute and output CMB convergence maps and find that the auto- and cross-power spectrum agrees with the theoretical prediction at the subpercent level.

In particular, the mass assembly of a halo and its progenitors, encapsulated in the form of its merger tree, serves as a fundamental input for constructing semi-analytic models of galaxy formation and, more generally, for building mock catalogues that emulate galaxy surveys. We present an algorithm for constructing halo merger trees from abacussummit, the largest suite of cosmological N-body simulations performed to date consisting of nearly 60 trillion particles, and which has been designed to meet the Cosmological Simulation Requirements of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. Our method tracks the cores of haloes to determine associations between objects across multiple time slices, yielding lists of halo progenitors and descendants for the several tens of billions of haloes identified across the entire suite. We present an application of these merger trees as a means to enhance the fidelity of abacussummit halo catalogues by flagging and ‘merging’ haloes deemed to exhibit non-monotonic past merger histories. We show that this cleaning technique identifies portions of the halo population that have been deblended due to choices made by the halo finder, but which could have feasibly been part of larger aggregate systems. We demonstrate that by cleaning halo catalogues in this post-processing step, we remove potentially unphysical features in the default halo catalogues, leaving behind a more robust halo population that can be used to create highly accurate mock galaxy realizations from abacussummit.}",

    abstract = "{We introduce the AbacusHOD model and present two applications of AbacusHOD and the AbacusSummit simulations to observations. AbacusHOD is a Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) framework written in Python that is particle-based, multitracer, highly generalized, and highly efficient. It is designed specifically with multitracer/cosmology analyses for next-generation large-scale structure surveys in mind, and takes advantage of the volume and precision offered by the new state-of-the-art AbacusSummit cosmological simulations. The model is also highly customizable and should be broadly applicable to any upcoming surveys and a diverse range of cosmological analyses. In this paper, we demonstrate the capabilities of the AbacusHOD framework through two example applications. The first example demonstrates the high efficiency and the large HOD extension feature set through an analysis of full-shape redshift-space clustering of BOSS galaxies at intermediate to small scales (\\$\\lt 30\\, h^\\{-1\\}\\$ Mpc), assessing the necessity of introducing secondary galaxy biases (assembly bias). We find strong evidence for using halo environment instead of concentration to trace secondary galaxy bias, a result which also leads to a moderate reduction in the ‘lensing is low’ tension. The second example demonstrates the multitracer capabilities of the AbacusHOD package through an analysis of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey cross-correlation measurements between three different galaxy tracers: luminous red galaxies, emission-line galaxies, and quasi-stellar objects. We expect the AbacusHOD framework, in combination with the AbacusSummit simulation suite, to play an important role in a simulation-based analysis of the upcoming Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument data sets.}",

Analysing two-point correlation functions measured in simulations using abacus , we show how observed deviations from self-similarity reveal the range of time and distance scales in which convergence is obtained. While the well-converged scales show accuracy below 1 per cent, our results show that, with a small force softening length, the spatial resolution is essentially determined by the mass resolution. At later times, the lower cut-off scale on convergence evolves in comoving units as a−1/2 (a being the scale factor), consistent with a hypothesis that it is set by two-body collisionality. A corollary of our results is that N-body simulations, particularly at high red-shift, contain a significant spatial range in which clustering appears converged with respect to the time-stepping and force softening but has not actually converged to the physical continuum result. The method developed can be applied to determine the resolution of any clustering statistic and extended to infer resolution limits for non-scale-free simulations.}",

We find that a proper softening that reaches roughly 1/30th of the inter-particle spacing by the end of the simulation resolves the same spatial and temporal scales as a comoving softening of the same length while using a third fewer time-steps, for a range of scale factors typical to Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) simulations.

Expressed as a suitable function of the scale-factor, accuracy shows a very simple n-dependence, allowing a extrapolation to place conservative bounds on the accuracy of N-body simulations of non-scale-free models like LCDM. We note that deviations due to discretization in the converged range are not well modelled by shot noise, and subtracting it in fact degrades accuracy. Quantitatively our findings are broadly in line with the conservative assumptions about resolution adopted by recent studies using large cosmological simulations (e.g. Euclid Flagship) aiming to constrain the mildly non-linear regime. On the other hand, we remark that conclusions about small-scale clustering (e.g. concerning the validity of stable clustering) obtained using PS data at wavenumbers larger than a few \\$k\_\\Lambda\\$ may need revision in light of our convergence analysis.}",
